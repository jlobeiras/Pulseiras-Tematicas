<img src="img/PulserasTematicas.jpg" width="500">

The included spreadsheet file contains an Excel template to create the custom bracelets using a label printer.
Plase make sure to only use special satin ribbon tape, as normal plastic label cartridges are not suitable for this project.
The row heigth is designed for 12mm satin ribbon tape and each row is a different bracelet which will be printet sequentially. You can add images like in the example, but please note that for optimal results they should be converted first to pure black and white.

**[ Custom colors ]**

For most label printers there are satin ribbon cartridges of different colors, but if you do not find the desired one you can just use the white tape and then apply color using fabric tint or acrylic paint.
